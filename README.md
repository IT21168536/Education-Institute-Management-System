Education Institute Management System

The Story of Shilpa Private Education Institute in Rathnapura District, which opened its doors in 2019, is a 
great story of continuous product improvement and the highest quality standards in education.
Students can study up to A/L in that institution. There are about 3000 students and 50 teachers
involved with this institute. This system has been developed in a user-friendly manner. We 
designed this project by contacting the manager of Shilpa private institute. Even in the pandemic 
this application will help to continue the education activities. This education institute 
management system is a web-base application that allows the management staff to handle all 
activities online.
Educational Institution Management System is based on managing the records of an institution 
and records of all students and staff. The first activity is based on entry as soon as students and 
staff make their admissions. They are given a unique registration number especially for his 
identification. The system also maintains the attendance details of a particular person. At the end 
of each month, the average percentage of each class attended. The student is shown. The system 
updates while storing the marks of each student separately. For classes for each student,
payments are made and managed by the system. The information and salary payable to each 
person is also in the fee report. Admin has the power to add details and new admins whenever 
needed. And he also has a right to edit or delete information to from that list. All information is 
being saved.
System Analysts are tasked with updating the system of all students at the end of the month.
Before starting this system, the main problem was not being able to store the financial
management of all employees and students at the end of the month and daily updated information.
Another advantage for students is that students can pay half of the class fee if they attend classes 
less than two days in month. This is the main benefit provided to the students by making the 
system and to the management board and the staff as above. Financial management is a very 
helpful factor for this institution.
